        <h2>Intro</h2>

        </div>
        <p>The Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is a leopard subspecies native to the Primorye region of
            southeastern Russia and northern China. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as in
            2007, only 19–26 wild leopards were estimated to survive in southeastern Russia and northeastern China.
            It is considered one of the rarest cats on Earth.

            As of 2015, fewer than 60 individuals were estimated to survive in Russia and China. Camera-trapping
            surveys conducted between 2014 and 2015 revealed 92 individuals in an 8,398 km2 (3,242 sq mi) large
            transboundary area along the Russian-Chinese border. In 2019, it was reported that the population was
            about 90 leopards. In 2021, it was reported the population was about 110 individuals.

            Results of genetic research indicate that the Amur leopard is genetically close to leopards in northern
            China and Korea, suggesting that the leopard population in this region became fragmented in the early 20th
            century. The North Chinese leopard was formerly recognised as a distinct subspecies (P. p. japonensis),
            but was subsumed under the Amur leopard in 2017.

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The names 'Amurland leopard' and 'Amur leopard' were coined by Pocock in 1930, when he compared leopard
            specimens in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. In particular, he referred to a leopard
            skin from the Amur Bay as 'Amur leopard'. Since at least 1985, this name has been used for the leopard
            subspecies in eastern Siberia and for the captive population in zoos worldwide.

            The Amur leopard is also known as the "Siberian leopard", "Far Eastern leopard", and "Korean
            leopard".
