        <h4>Dear friend,</h4>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            I hope this letter can reach you. I have so much to tell you. I can't believe It already past 5 years
            since I leave my home.
            England it's amazin, you would love it! Lively streets all night, people everywhere. Big houses and
            ships. So much different then our city.
            I am so happy I came to this trip. How greate would be with you here to enjoy with me. Ah, I live in a
            "apartment", can you believe it? Here we don't need to boy houses,
            we can just rent a home and pay everymonth to stay here. The one I am living it's not big, but, it's
            confortable at least, and cheap!
            I got go to work now. Yes, I have one! in a restaurant. They don't pay much but the owner is so nice
            with me.
            And how is everyone in there? I miss everyone so much! Can't wait to see you all and tell you my storys.
        </p>

            PS: Don't let your wife worry about you!
            See you.
